# Pattern Lab Patterns Generator

## Prerequistes 

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed
- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) installed by running: `npm install --global yo`
- Install this generator with: `npm install --global generator-pattern-lab-patterns`

## Useage

```bash
yo pattern-lab-patterns
```

**Pro Tip**: You can just run `yo` and it'll give you a list of all your installed generators which you can select & run. Much faster and easier to remember.

This will provide you a list of all the Pattern Bundles you can get (which is simply a list of folder we have in this repo under `app/templates/`). After chosing, it'll copy the patterns into your directory. This can be ran inside a pre-existing project and it can even be ran with other patterns already present! It'll ask you before overriting any file.
